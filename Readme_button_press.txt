         Analog Devices, Inc. EV-COG-AD3029LZ Application Example

Project Name: Readme_button_press.

Description:  Use the GPIO driver to Toggle LED's when the push buttons are 
              pressed on the EV-COG-AD3029LZ.
              
Overview:
=========
    This example uses the GPIO driver to configure the push buttons (GPIO input)
    and LED's (GPIO output) on the EV-COG-AD3029LZ.  An interrupt is generated by
    the push buttons which executes a callback to toggle the LED's.Pressing BTN1 toggles
    LED-1 while BTN2 toggles LED-2.

User Configuration Macros:
==========================
    None.
    
Hardware Setup:
===============
    EV-COG-AD3029LZ should be configured with default settings jumper 
    settings. Please refer EV-COG-AD3029LZ Manual for default 
    jumper settings.

External connections:
=====================
    None.

How to build and run:
=====================    
    Prepare hardware as explained in the Hardware Setup section.
    Build the project, load the executable to ADuCM3029, and run it.

Expected Result:
=================        
    Press BTN1 or BTN2 to toggle LED1 and LED2 on the EV-COG-AD3029LZ. 
    The example waits for the button press. If no buttons are pressed, it will timeout after sometime 
	and prints "All Done!".
